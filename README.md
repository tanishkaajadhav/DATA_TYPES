(a) DATA TYPES – DATATYPES.cpp

AIM: To demonstrate various data types in C++ and their usage with user input.

APPARATUS: Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:
C++ provides several fundamental data types to store different kinds of data:

int → stores integer values

float → stores decimal values with single precision

double → stores decimal values with double precision

char → stores single characters

bool → stores Boolean values (true or false)

The sizeof() operator is used to determine the memory occupied by each data type. Understanding data types is essential for efficient memory usage, type safety, and correct program execution.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare variables for different data types (int, float, double, char, bool).

Prompt the user to input values for each variable.

Display the entered values.

Optionally, display the size of each data type using sizeof().

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:
The program demonstrates how to use and manage different data types in C++ effectively. It allows user input for various types and shows how memory is allocated for each, providing foundational knowledge for C++ programming.
